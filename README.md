# Bigigin

The bigigin is a small 2d game engine created in the course programming 4 in DAE. This engine might get some additions afterwards. 

# Patterns
The patterns used in this engine are:

Game loop
Update method
Component
Dirty flag
Command
Observer
Event queue
Singleton
Service locator
State

# Development
some things that still have to be finished developing in the engine are the inputmanager and the soundsystem(which will include multithreading for playing the sounds). pImpl might also be used for the input.

# Choices
I didn't have time to think about making certain choices, because the engine isn't completely fnished yet.

# Data
Very basic start of an engine provided by dae, which was improved upon.
The sprites/levels/sounds are provided by an example project of an old project from dae.
